# Smart-Lamp
Our mission statment is to design a smart desk lamp, catering to those with cognitive disabilities and limited mobility, to decrease the negative effects of blue light.
The lamp adjusts the amount of light it emits based on the surrrounding lux value and its color based on the time of day. It would emit blue light in the morning to wake the user up and orange light in the evening to relax the user.
